    "A quadratic arithmetic program is an arithmetic circuit, specifically a *Rank 1 Constraint System (R1CS)* represented as a set of polynomials. It is derived using *Lagrange interpolation* on a Rank 1 Constraint System. Unlike an R1CS, a Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP) can be tested for equality in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time via the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma. Note that we do have the overhead of \"converting\" the vectors in polynomials but it is acceptable as we will see toards the end.  \n",
