    "# Rank 1 Constraint System overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A Rank 1 Constraint System (R1CS) is an arithmetic circuit with the requirement that each **equality constraint** has one multiplication (and no restriction on the number of additions). This makes the representation of the arithmetic circuit compatible with the use of bilinear pairings.  \n",
    "The output of a pairing $G_1 \\cdot G_2 \\to G_T$ cannot be paired again, as an element in cannot be used as part of the input of another pairing. Hence, we only allow one multiplication per constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The witness vector\n",
    "In a Rank 1 Constraint System the witness vector is a $1 \\times n$ vector that contains the value of all the input variables, the output variable, and the intermediate values. It shows you have executed the circuit from start to finish, knowing both the input, output, and all the intermediate values.  \n",
    "E.g.:  \n",
    "$$z = x^2y$$\n",
    "If we know the solution to this we must know $x, y, z$. However as per R1CS, only one multiplication is allowed per contraint so we rewrite the above as\n",
    "$$v_1 = xx$$\n",
    "$$z = v_1y$$\n",
    "Now, a *witness* means we not only know $x, y, z$ but also intermediate values i.e. $v_1$. So the vector will be :\n",
    "$$[1, z, x, y, v_1]$$\n",
    "one example is\n",
    "$$[1, 18,3, 2, 9]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transforming into R1CS\n",
    "We want out contraints to be of the form `result = left_hand_side x right_hand_side`\n",
    "$$\\underbrace{z}_\\text{result} = \\underbrace{x}_\\text{left hand side} \\times \\underbrace{y}_\\text{right hand side}$$\n",
    "In the end our goal is to create system of equations of form:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{O}\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{a}\\circ\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{a}$$\n",
    "Where $O, L, R$ are matrices of size $n \\times m$ and $a$ is the witness vector. \n",
